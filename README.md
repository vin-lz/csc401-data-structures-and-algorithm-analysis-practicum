# csc401-data-structures-and-algorithm-analysis-practicum
CSC401 is the practicum associated with CSC317.

CSC317 is a course on algorithmic thinking. The CSC317 mainline in the course does not require programming. It is highly recommended that students enroll in CSC401 the Practicum, for experience coding algorithms, and for the experience of using dynamic HTML and Javascript to create imaginative animations of the algorithms presented in the course. The Practicum is a one-credit course; its format is self study and there are no formal lectures assigned. We will point you to relevant references, and include some example code alongside the assignments that will help you get started. Unlike the main course which has a problem set assigned every week, the Practicum will include a smaller set of programming assignments.
